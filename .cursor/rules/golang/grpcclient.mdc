Pull in the package from github.cbhq.net/engineering/csf/grpcclient

Here is an example of how you should implement it
```
    manager := csf.New()
    ctx := manager.ServiceContext()
        conn, err := grpcclient.Dial(
                ctx,
                endpoint,
                grpcclient.WithDialOpt(grpc.WithBlock()),
        )
```
