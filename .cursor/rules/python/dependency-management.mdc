# Dependency Management

## Package Management
- Use Poetry for dependency management
- Pin all dependencies with exact versions
- Use separate dependency groups for dev and prod
- Regular security audits with safety
- Keep dependencies up to date

## Virtual Environments
- Use virtual environments for all projects
- Document Python version requirements
- Use .env files for environment variables
- Keep production dependencies minimal
- Document all third-party integrations
