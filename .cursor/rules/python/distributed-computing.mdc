# Distributed Computing Standards

## Ray Framework Usage
- Use Ray for distributed task processing
- Implement proper actor patterns
- Use Ray's object store effectively
- Handle distributed errors properly

## Scaling Patterns
- Implement proper auto-scaling
- Use resource management effectively
- Handle node failures gracefully
- Implement proper checkpointing

## Performance
- Use Ray's performance monitoring
- Implement proper batching
- Use Ray's memory management
- Profile distributed operations
